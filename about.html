                <h2>Hello! I’m Gaurav</h2>
                <p>I am a Computer Science student at Poornima College of Enginnering, where I’m currently pursuing my
                    passion for technology and innovation. My journey into the world of computers started early, and
                    over the years, I have developed a keen interest in software development, algorithms, and data
                    science.</p>

                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>During my time at Poornima College of Enginnering, I have engaged in a variety of coursework and
                    projects that have
                    helped me build a solid foundation in computer science. Some of the key areas I’ve focused on
                    include:</p>
                    
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong><br> Experienced in creating dynamic and responsive websites using
                        modern web technologies. Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with hands-on experience in
                        frameworks and libraries such as React and Bootstrap, enabling me to build visually appealing
                        and user-friendly web applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Development:</strong><br> Experienced in building applications using modern
                        frameworks and tools. Notable projects include [briefly describe a significant project, e.g., "a
                        website of booking tickets for a movie].</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Science:</strong><br> Gained hands-on experience with data analysis and visualization
                        using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib..</li>
                </ul>
                    

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>I have worked on several interesting projects that showcase my skills and passion for technology.
                    Some of my notable projects include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Movie Ticket Management :</strong> I made Website for booking tickets for a movie. In
                        that website we can select any movie and can book tickets in any theatre.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loan Calculator:</strong> I made a loan calculator by which we can calculate loan
                        amount. we have to fill loan amount, interest and tenure then the total amount and many things
                        will come on our screen including a graph. </li>
                    <li><strong>Random Joke Generator:</strong> I made a Joke generator which generates jokes randomly.
                        We get every time a different joke when we click "another joke" button. </li>
                    <li><strong>Colour Changing Box:</strong> I made a colour changing box which changes colour and
                        shapes ramdomly when clicked on buttons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Catch me if you can :</strong> I made a box which changes its position when the cursor
                        is put on that box. we can't catch it by the cursor.</li>
                    <li><strong>LED cube:</strong> This is my hardware project which i have made with the help of
                        teamates. In this cube we can make any of the shape we want, only we have to write code. We can
                        make any logo of any college with the help of different colour LED lights. </li>
                </ul>


                <h2>My Passion</h2>
                <p>Beyond academics, I am deeply interested in artificial
                    intelligence and its potential to transform industries. I actively seek out opportunities to learn
                    and grow, whether through online courses, coding challenges, or participating in tech meetups and
                    hackathons.</p>

                <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                <p>As I continue my studies, I am excited about the future and the potential to contribute to innovative
                    projects and technologies. I am particularly interested in working in software development or data
                    science, where I can apply my skills to
                    solve real-world problems.</p>
